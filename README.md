# Transport Project

## 1. Concept
### 1.1 
The idea of the application is to store and manipulate data about vehicles, their routes and mileage, and perform actions.

The main focus is that the battery level of vehicles will be tracked. 

If the battery falls below 20% a flag will be set that the vehicle requires charging. 

If the battery is insufficient for the assigned route, it will not let the vehicle perform the route.

   
## 2. Usage
